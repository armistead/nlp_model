## Word Rec'R

<span class="emphasized">
An introduction to a Coursera data science track project brought to you by [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) and [Swiftkey](https://swiftkey.com/en).

### Hypothesis: a prediction model can be built based on the [Heliohost]((http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/)) dataset.

#### Based on testing and research, we find that it is possible with a handful of R packages, but memory issues and prediction accuracy remain a concern.
</div>

## Challenges
### Pitfalls and stumbling blocks include
#### 1. Text conversions from corpus to matrix to data frames and back again.
#### 2. Package version handling, e.g. tm requires content_transformer in the most recent version.
#### 3. Size handling, i.e. due to space constraints, I had to make do with a smaller dataset.
